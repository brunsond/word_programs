# word_programs
Contains programs for dealing with strings.

The program word_sort.py takes in a single-line, comma-delimited list of words
in the user-provided file words.txt and creates a new file called words_sorted.txt
which is a single-column alphabetized list of the words.  The file in this repository
called words.txt serves as an example for testing.
